            <h2>The Matchup</h2>
            <p>Clemson came into the game ranked #2 in the nation. They had a couple of scares during the season, namely a game against NC State that went to overtime only because NC State missed a 33 yard field goal. Because of this, many did not believe they belonged here. Alabama came into this game ranked #1 in the nation. Most people even said they were the best college football team of all time as they dominated every opponent they faced. They were the clear favorite.</p>

            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>Alabama came out of gate rolling. Clemson received the kickoff, but even still Alabama went up 14-0 early in the 2nd quarter. Clemson's QB Deshaun Watson put the team on his back as he managed a tough 8 yard scramble into the end zone to cut the lead to 14-7. However, after a costly interception thrown by Watson, Alabama grew the lead to 17-7. Clemson responded with a TD to bring the game back to 17-14. However, Alabama reminded the world why they were ranked the best team in the nation as they grew the lead to 24-14 with a TD of their own. Clemson responded with a TD to drop the lead to 3. Clemson then got their first lead of the game with another TD late in the game making the game 28-24. Alabama then crushed the hearts of Clemson fans as their QB Jalen Hurts managed to muster a 30 yard rushing TD with only 2 minutes left. Then came one of the greatest drives in all of college football. The Watson led Tigers marched down to the 2 yard line, down by 3 with only 6 seconds left. On what would be the last play of the game, Deshaun Watson threw a game winning TD pass to Hunter Renfrow, winning the National Championship game.</p>
